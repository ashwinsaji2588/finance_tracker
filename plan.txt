Building a Personal Finance and Portfolio Tracker is a top-tier project for a backend developer. It proves you can handle sensitive data, integrate complex third-party APIs, and design a system where accuracy is non-negotiable.

Since you're working with Java and Spring Boot professionally, this is the perfect stack to showcase "Enterprise-grade" thinking.

1. System Architecture & Core Modules
For a FinTech app, you should aim for a Modular Monolith or Microservices approach to show scalability.

User Management & Auth (Identity Module): Handles registration, login, and secure session management.

Transaction Engine (Finance Module): Manages the CRUD of daily expenses and income. Includes logic for recurring payments (e.g., monthly rent).

Market Data Aggregator (Portfolio Module): Fetches real-time prices for stocks, mutual funds, or crypto using external APIs.

Reporting & Analytics Engine: Processes raw data into insights (e.g., "You spent 30% more on dining this month").

2. Advanced Technical Features (The "Resume Winners")
To make this stand out from a basic "Expense Tracker," focus on these high-level implementations:

A. Security First (FinTech Essentials)
OAuth2 & JWT: Use Spring Security with JWT for stateless authentication.

Data Encryption at Rest: Use AES-256 to encrypt sensitive fields in your database (like account names or specific notes).

Rate Limiting: Implement a bucket-brigade or sliding window algorithm (using Resilience4j or Redis) to prevent API abuse.

B. Real-Time Portfolio Tracking
API Integration: Use Alpha Vantage, Finnhub, or Yahoo Finance API to fetch live tickers.

Caching with Redis: Don't hit the external API for every user request. Cache stock prices for 1–5 minutes in Redis to improve performance and save API credits.

C. Database Design (PostgreSQL/MySQL)
Your schema needs to be robust to handle many-to-many relationships and historical data.

Table	Key Fields
Users	id, email (unique), password_hash, created_at
Transactions	id, user_id, amount, category_id, type (Credit/Debit), date
Portfolios	id, user_id, asset_symbol, quantity, average_buy_price
Categories	id, name (Food, Rent, Salary), user_id (for custom categories)
3. Implementation Roadmap
Phase 1 (The Foundation): Set up Spring Boot with Spring Data JPA. Create the basic Expense/Income REST APIs.

Phase 2 (The Security): Integrate Spring Security. Add a "User" context so people can only see their own data.

Phase 3 (The Portfolio): Write a service to consume a Stock API. Calculate the "Current Value" vs. "Invested Value."

Phase 4 (The Polish): Use Spring Batch or Scheduled Tasks to generate a weekly summary email or PDF report using iText/JasperReports.

4. How to describe this on your Resume
Personal Finance & Investment Tracker | Java, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, Redis

Designed a secure FinTech backend supporting 100+ concurrent users with OAuth2/JWT authentication.

Integrated Alpha Vantage API for real-time portfolio valuation, implementing Redis caching to reduce external API latency by 60%.

Developed a recurring transaction engine using Spring Task Scheduler to automate monthly budget tracking.

Implemented AES-256 encryption for sensitive user financial data, ensuring compliance with data privacy best practices.

Would you like me to help you design the specific SQL schema for the Portfolio tracking part, or perhaps a sample Java controller to fetch live stock prices?
